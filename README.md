# Climate-Project

This is a data visualisation project about the effects of cli,ate change in the UK. 
We have access to monthly statistics of av. temp., min. temp., max. temp., rainfall and other usint the MET Office website database. The records contain data from 1885 up to now (May 2024).

The initial obejective of the project is to visualize any changes in tempreture that could be atrributed to Global Warming - meaning we need to notice a steady increase in year to year readings. The dataset, however, includes a bunxh more than just temperatures which raises the posibility of exploring the impact on other environmental factors once the a clear relationship has been established.

First step of the project would be to do a comparison analysis on Min., Max. and Avg. temperatures for a single UK region a contained in the dataset.
