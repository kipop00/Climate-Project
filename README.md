# Climate-Project

This is a data visualisation project about the effects of climate change in the UK. 
We have access to monthly statistics of av. temp., min. temp., max. temp., rainfall and others using the MET Office website database. The records contain data from 1885 up to now (May 2024).

The project's initial objective is to visualize any changes in temperature that could be attributed to Global Warming - meaning we need to notice a steady increase in year-to-year readings. However, the dataset includes more than just temperatures, which raises the possibility of exploring the impact on other environmental factors once a clear relationship has been established.

The project's first step would be to do a comparison analysis on Min., Max. and Avg. temperatures for a single UK region contained in the dataset.

1. Initial observations show a 98% correlation between annual max temp and annual mean temp. Leading me to think about how mean annual temp is being calculated in the first place.

2. Questions to answer? Trends over the past 50 years? Global warming started around 1950 and the data shows a significant increase in the trend around that time. By identifying changes in different regions and detecting any abnormalities the main thing to look at:
\n Can we find any factors on the small scale that would indicate the impact of climate change?
